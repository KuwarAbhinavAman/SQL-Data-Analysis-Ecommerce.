## Introduction

This task focused on performing data analysis using SQL to uncover sales patterns in the `sales_data` table of an `Ecommerce` database. The queries aim to:

- Aggregate product sales data.
- Calculate the total revenue generated by each product.
- Identify high-selling products.
- Filter data based on specific date ranges.
- Analyze the average revenue per customer.

## Queries Executed

### 1. Retrieve First 10 Records from Sales Data
This query retrieves a sample of the first 10 records from the `sales_data` table.

```sql
SELECT * FROM sales_data LIMIT 10;
2. Total Quantity Sold per Product
This query calculates the total quantity sold for each product, ordered by the total quantity in descending order

SELECT ProductNo, SUM(Quantity) AS TotalQuantity
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY ProductNo
ORDER BY TotalQuantity DESC;


3. Total Quantity Sold per Product (After January 1, 2011)
This query filters sales data after January 1, 2011, to calculate the total quantity sold for each product.

SELECT ProductNo, SUM(Quantity) AS TotalQuantity
FROM sales_data
WHERE Date >= '01-01-2011'  
GROUP BY ProductNo
ORDER BY TotalQuantity DESC;


4. Total Revenue per Product
This query calculates the total revenue generated by each product, based on the unit price and quantity sold, ordered by total revenue in descending order.


SELECT ProductNo, SUM(UnitPrice * Quantity) AS TotalRevenue
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY ProductNo
ORDER BY TotalRevenue DESC;



5. Average Revenue per Customer
This query calculates the average revenue per customer, based on the unit price and quantity sold for each order.

SELECT CustomerID, AVG(UnitPrice * Quantity) AS AvgRevenue
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY CustomerID;


6. Total Quantity Sold per Product (After January 12, 2010)
This query filters sales data after January 12, 2010, to calculate the total quantity sold for each product, limiting the result to 1000 rows.

SELECT ProductNo, SUM(Quantity) AS TotalQuantity
FROM sales_data
WHERE STR_TO_DATE(Date, '%d-%m-%Y %H:%i') >= STR_TO_DATE('12-01-2010 00:00', '%d-%m-%Y %H:%i')
GROUP BY ProductNo
ORDER BY TotalQuantity DESC
LIMIT 1000;



7. Products with Quantity Sold Above the Average
This query finds products that have sold more than the average quantity across all products.


SELECT ProductNo, SUM(Quantity) AS TotalQuantity
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY ProductNo
HAVING TotalQuantity > (
  SELECT AVG(Quantity) FROM sales_data
);



8. Create View for High Selling Products
This query creates a view called HighSellingProducts, which stores products with total quantities sold greater than 1000.


CREATE VIEW HighSellingProducts AS
SELECT ProductNo, SUM(Quantity) AS TotalQuantity
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY ProductNo
HAVING TotalQuantity > 1000;



9. Retrieve High Selling Products
This query retrieves all records from the HighSellingProducts view.

SELECT * FROM HighSellingProducts;


10. Identify Records with Null Values
This query checks for any records where either ProductNo or UnitPrice contains null values. In this case, no null values were found.


SELECT *
FROM sales_data
WHERE ProductNo IS NULL OR UnitPrice IS NULL;



Task Summary
The SQL queries performed in this task aim to:

Aggregate and analyze the total quantity and revenue per product.

Identify high-selling products by filtering based on sales thresholds.

Calculate average revenue per customer.

Create a view for high-selling products.

Detect any records with missing values in critical fields (though no null values were found in this dataset).

Technologies Used
SQL: For querying and manipulating the sales_data table.

MySQL: SQL queries were executed on a MySQL database.
